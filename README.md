# Food Truck Project

### Description

This is a simple application to enter Food Trucks information.
The user is asked to enter up to 5 different food trucks and enter their name,
type of food and rating, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck.

### Topics and Technologies Used
Topics:

Conditionals (if/else/switch)

Looping (while loops)

Methods

Encapsulation

Objects and Classes

### Technologies :

Java

Eclipse

Git

### How to Run
the user will be prompt to enter up to 5 different trucks, if the user enters the word "quit" for the food truck name, input ends immediately and the program continues.

A menu will be display for the user to enter an option to view all the trucks information, check the average rating or the best rating truck, if the option to quit is selected the program will end.

### Lessons Learned
For this project i would say that the most challenging part for me was figuring out how to fill out an array of objects using a loop, but i definitely feel more comfortable working with objects and encapsulation it also gave me a little bit more practice with arrays.
